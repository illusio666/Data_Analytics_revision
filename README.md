# Jupyter Notebook-based Revision sheets

**Feel free to copy** my Data Analytics study notes on Pandas and other statistical functions, courtesy of a collab with Copilot, to summarise the key headlines.

No detail, just a reminder of the functions I've come across to enable me to look up the more detailed syntax for my need.


## Jupyter notebook structure
1. Chart_chart - the different charts that can be plotted and when to use each
2. Numpy_key_words - quick basic reminder on arrays
3. Dataframes_one_word_instructions - those pesky quick instructions that I can never remember, along with any variables that they can take/variable purpose
4.....more to follow as we go/as I clean up the older content to be fit for consumption
